# Syllabus for CS 6431 

Welcome to CS  6431, security and privacy technologies. This is a PhD-level
course focused on academic research in computer security. We will take a 
tour of a variety of contemporary research topics, with an eye towards not only
learning something about the individual topics, but also dissecting what makes
for successful research in computer security. Computer security is quite
broad,  which is one of its appeals -- security issues arise in any area, and
security is hard. 
 

Instructor: Tom Ristenpart (he/him) (https://rist.tech.cornell.edu)

### Course logistics and classrooms 

PhD classes taught by Cornell Tech instructors, including this one, are
broadcast to both Cornell campuses, in NYC and Ithaca.  Protocols for masking
and other COVID-19 precautions will follow those rules at the respective campus.
Wear a mask and don't come in if feeling ill, please! If you have concerns about
COVID-19 safety feel free to reach out to me. 

Note that the Gates hall room was changed from G11 to G13, which is slightly
bigger. 

A zoom link will be shared via Canvas. I might occassionally deliver lectures
remotely using the same zoom link, and will announce that via the schedule (see
below). The default will be in-person instruction from NYC. Please attend class
in-person when I'm teaching in-person; please let me know if you need to attend
remotely. If so, the default should be camera on. 

That said, I should be able to monitor Zoom chat in case students want to ask
questions or make comments, in addition to raising hands during class. This may
help depending on AV setup quality. 

Classrooms: G13 (Gates Hall, Ithaca) and B091 (Bloomberg, NYC) 


### Pre-requisites

This class is for CS PhD students, though PhD students from other
departments with suitable background may get a lot out of it as well. Please
contact me if you have concerns about your background. 

Space allowing, I will make exceptions for undergrads or masters students who
have significant research or other relevant experience.  

If interested, please come to the first day of class or contact me soon after; 
this will give me a sense of demand and how we are doing on physical space. 


### Requirements

The class will focus on topics in computer security. You will need to read
papers prior to class, and be engaged in discussions. I hope to set aside time
during class for small group discussions on papers, though we may have to
experiment a bit with the AV setup.  

* Class participation:  20% 
* Problem sets: 20%
* Project proposal: 20%
* Project: 40%

Problem sets will be on topics discussed in papers, and will test your
understanding of the papers. I will not grade these in detail, but rather
perform random spot checks to ensure appropriate effort. Late days will
be allowed if I haven't gotten around to spot checking yet. 

The project will be the biggest piece of this class; the class is, after all, an
introduction to research in computer security. Projects can be in small groups
that will depend on final enrollment. I will update the schedule with
information on due dates. 


### Project

See [this PDF](https://github.com/tomrist/cs6431-fall2021/blob/main/project.pdf) for a discussion of project and deliverables. It may still be
updated, ask me if you have questions.
